      "Imposter syndrome is when individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence of their competence. In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome due to the technical complexity and the presence of highly capable individuals. It is highlighted that imposter syndrome is common even among accomplished people in the AI community, and the message is to not let it discourage anyone from pursuing growth in AI.\n",
